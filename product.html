    <p>A dangerous underlying ailment could be indicated by exceptionally high or low heart rates, which Apple Watch monitors for in the background. This might aid in pointing out circumstances that might call for additional investigation for you and your patients.The user will be alerted if a patient's heart rate is above 120 or below 40 while they appear to have been inactive for 10 minutes. Patients can change the threshold bpm or enable or disable these notifications. On an iPhone, the Health app allows you to display all heart rate notifications as well as time, date, and heart rate.</p>

    <p>Periodically, the irregular rhythm notification looks for indications of abnormal rhythms that might be indicative of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Although not all cases of AFib will be picked up by this function, it might pick up on something that can give your patients a heads-up that more testing might be necessary.When the user is at rest, irregular rhythm notifications employ the optical heart sensor to detect the wrist pulse wave and seek for variability in beat-to-beat intervals. A message will be sent to your patient and the date, time, and beat-to-beat heart rate will be recorded in the Health app if the algorithm frequently identifies an irregular rhythm that is suggestive of AFib.The irregular rhythm notification function of an FDA-cleared patch ECG was tested in a clinical research.</p>

    <p>The ECG app records a single-lead ECG that is equivalent to a Lead I ECG using the electrical heart sensor embedded into the Digital Crown and the rear crystal. The ECG app asks the user to enter any symptoms such a rapid or pounding heartbeat, dizziness, or exhaustion before displaying a result of sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation with high heart rate, inconclusive, or poor recording. A non-AFib arrhythmia, the presence of a pacemaker or ICD, or a weak electrical signal, which might be caused by right axis deviation, can all lead to an ambiguous outcome. The Health app allows you to export the recorded waveform, results, date, time, and any symptoms as a PDF file to share with a doctor.</p>

    <p>Mobility and cardiovascular fitness can be strong indicators of overall physical health and a predictor of long-term well-being. Apple Watch and iPhone can provide estimates of mobility metrics to give you and your patients a better understanding of how they impact mobility today and provide tools to monitor these factors over time. Mobility metrics include Cardio Fitness (VO2 max), Six-Minute Walk Distance, and other metrics used to measure walking quality (Walking Speed, Step Length, Double Support Time, and Walking Asymmetry). These metrics can be utilized for research and app development with the user’s permission.</p>

    <p>When a hard fall is detected with Apple Watch Series 4 or later, an alert appears and allows the user to easily call emergency services or dismiss the alert. If the user is unresponsive for about a minute, an emergency call will be placed automatically and a message will be sent to the user’s emergency contacts. All falls detected are recorded in the Health app. This feature is automatically enabled for users 55 years and older and can be turned on for anyone in the Apple Watch app on iPhone.</p>

    <p>Medical ID allows first responders and emergency room clinicians to access critical medical information from a patient’s iPhone Lock Screen or Apple Watch without requiring a passcode and without compromising patient privacy. Patients can list important information such as allergies, medications, conditions, organ donor preferences, and emergency contacts by setting up Medical ID in the Health app on iPhone.</p>
